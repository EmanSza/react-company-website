# Company Site

This project was just a hobby work on a fake "game development" website. This project is intended to show off my early work with React as I get more use to working with Frontend librarys.

This intended to be a One page website. This website was designed with a "startup" in mind. a Game Development Studio that has expereince assisting other studios with work. Since a studio like this wouldnt have any self-developed games, they show off expereince thru partnerships with companys they worked with. hence the "work" section
